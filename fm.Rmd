## Read in relevant data

  zap_formats() %>% 
  zap_labels() %>% 
  select(caseid, la0102, doc0102) %>% 
  mutate(school = case_when(la0102 == "1" ~ "Williams",
                            la0102 == "3" ~ "Swarthmore",
                            doc0102 == "1" ~ "Princeton",

## Absurd hack needed to deal with weird Stata attributes

## attributes(x.1$caseid) <- NULL

## Deal with school average SAT data, which was not distributed with the other
## NLSF data and comes to us directly from Douglas Massey.

x.col <- read_stata("nlsfcolleges.dta") %>% 
  zap_formats() 

x.id.cross <- read_excel("Case ID Crosswalk.xlsx", col_names = FALSE) %>% 
  select(- X__1) %>% 
  rename(case = X__2, caseid = X__3)

x.col <- 
  left_join(x.col, x.id.cross, by = "case") %>% 
  select(caseid, w1coll)

## Seems to be a problem that caseid 9277726 does not appear in this data,
## causing problems later when we try to figure out her school.

x.sat <- read_excel("School SAT Averages.xlsx") %>% 
  rename(w1coll = 'School ID', school_SAT = "Ave SAT")

x.2 <- left_join(x.col, x.sat, by = "w1coll")

## Note how there is 1 NA in caseid. That strikes me as a problem!

## Bring the first two data sets together.

x <- left_join(x.1, x.2, by = "caseid")

## We don't need both `school` and `w1coll` variables since they capture the
## same thing. It is also a bad idea to have a categorical variable like w1coll
## represented by numbers. So, create a new variable `college` which will be the
## college's name for schools we know (like Yale) and `School.N` (where N is the
## current value of `w1coll`) for schools we don't know. Then, drop `school` and
## `w1coll` from x. Then, show a table of `x$college`.

x <- x %>% 
  mutate(college = case_when(
    ! is.na(school) ~ school, 
    is.na(school) & ! is.na(w1coll) ~ paste("School", w1coll, sep = "."),
    is.na(w1coll) &   is.na(w1coll) ~ as.character(NA))) %>% 
  select(-school, -w1coll)

## Does it seem sensible that there are schools with more than 300 students in
## the sample?

## Grab student SAT/ACT data

x.3 <- read_stata("nlsfw3p.dta.zip") %>% 
  zap_formats() %>%
  zap_labels() %>% 
  select(caseid, w3q28, w3q28a, w3q28b, w3q28c) %>% 
  rename(testing = w3q28, verbal = w3q28a, math = w3q28b, ACT = w3q28c) %>%
  mutate_at(vars(verbal, math), 
            function(x){
              x <- ifelse(x %in% c(997, 998) | x < 200, NA, x)
              }) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(ACT), 
            function(x){
              x <- ifelse(x %in% c(97, 98), NA, x)
              }) %>% 
  mutate(SAT = math + verbal) %>% 
  select(-testing, -verbal, -math)

## Grab GPA data. I *think* that this comes from nlsfw5p.dta.zip and that the
## variables you want are `w5q20aa` and `w5q20ab`. Note that this is tricky
## stuff, with weirdly formatted character (!) variables gthat include obvious
## mistakes. I needed trickery like `gsub("\\.","",x)`. I also deleted/trimmed
## outliers.

x.4 <- read_stata("nlsfw5p.dta.zip") %>% 
  zap_formats() %>%
  zap_labels() %>% 
  select(caseid, w5q20aa, w5q20ab) %>% 
  na_if("") %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(w5q20aa, w5q20ab), 
            function(x) {x <- gsub("\\.","",x)}) %>%  ## Deal with a couple of random "."
  mutate(w5q20aa = ifelse(w5q20aa %in% as.character(c(1:4)), w5q20aa, NA)) %>% 
  mutate(col.gpa = as.numeric(paste(w5q20aa, w5q20ab, sep = "."))) %>% 
  select(caseid, col.gpa)

## Bring stuff together. What happened to that NA?!?

x <- left_join(x, x.3, by = "caseid")
x <- left_join(x, x.4, by = "caseid")

## Grab race (w1qzeth) and sex data from nlsfw1p.dta.zip. Change both to factor
## variables with levels as you see in my summary.

x.5 <- read_stata("nlsfw1p.dta.zip") %>%
  zap_formats() %>% 
  zap_labels() %>% 
  select(caseid, sex, w1qzeth) %>% 
  mutate(sex = factor(sex, labels = c("female", "male")),
         race = factor(w1qzeth, labels = c("Asian", "Black", "Hispanic", "White"))) %>% 
  select(-w1qzeth)

x <- x %>% left_join(x.5, by = 'caseid') %>% 
  select(- starts_with("col.per")) %>% 
  select(caseid, sex, race, college, ACT, SAT, col.gpa, school_SAT)

## Always a good idea to do some error checking.

stopifnot(nrow(x) == 3924)
stopifnot(! any(is.na(x$sex)))
stopifnot(! any(is.na(x$race)))
```
