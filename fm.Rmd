  ## More and more I think that this school information should be hard-coded
  ## against w1coll, as we do with Howard below. We can hand-inspect the values
  ## of la102 and so on, but the ties make it bad to use this variable as an
  ## assignment. (More than one school can be the 3rd rated LAC by US News in a
  ## given year.)
  
  mutate(school = case_when(la0102 == "1" ~ "Williams",
                            la0102 == "3" ~ "Swarthmore",

## Deal with school average SAT data, which was not distributed with the other
## NLSF data and comes to us directly from Douglas Massey.

  zap_formats() 

x.id.cross <- read_excel("Case ID Crosswalk.xlsx", col_names = FALSE) %>% 
  select(- X__1) %>% 
  rename(case = X__2, caseid = X__3)

## No row for 9277726 in x.id.cross. Argg! I was fooled because x.id.cross does
## have 3,924 rows. If we assume that the case in x.col which has no match in
## x.id.cross is the missing one, we can just assign 9277726 to w1coll 26. So,
## we do. When we left_join on x.col, we lose the caseid for 9277726 but we know
## that we w1coll is 26.

x.col <- 
  left_join(x.col, x.id.cross, by = "case") %>%

## Note how there is 1 NA in caseid. That strikes me as a problem!

## Bring the first two data sets together.

x <- left_join(x.1, x.2, by = "caseid")

## We don't need both `school` and `w1coll` variables since they capture the
## same thing. It is also a bad idea to have a categorical variable like w1coll
## represented by numbers. So, create a new variable `college` which will be the
## college's name for schools we know (like Yale) and `School.N` (where N is the
## current value of `w1coll`) for schools we don't know. Then, drop `school` and
## `w1coll` from x. Then, show a table of `x$college`.

x <- x %>% 
  mutate(college = case_when(

## Does it seem sensible that there are schools with more than 300 students in

## Grab GPA data. I *think* that this comes from nlsfw5p.dta.zip and that the
## variables you want are `w5q20aa` and `w5q20ab`. Note that this is tricky
## stuff, with weirdly formatted character (!) variables gthat include obvious
## mistakes. I needed trickery like `gsub("\\.","",x)`. I also deleted/trimmed
## outliers.

## Grab race (w1qzeth) and sex data from nlsfw1p.dta.zip. Change both to factor
## variables with levels as you see in my summary.

x.5 <- read_stata("nlsfw1p.dta.zip") %>%

  select(-w1qzeth)

x <- x %>% left_join(x.5, by = 'caseid')## %>% 
  ## select(caseid, sex, race, college, ACT, SAT, col.gpa, school_SAT)

## Always a good idea to do some error checking.

stopifnot(nrow(x) == 3924)
stopifnot(! any(is.na(x$sex)))
stopifnot(! any(is.na(x$race)))
